# Euler-WCness

In this repository the exhaustive study of the 4D cases is provided.

- In the file [exhaustive_list.txt](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Euler-WCness/blob/master/exhaustive_list.txt), a list with `(Int, [[Int]],Bool, Bool)` where the first element is the size of the set of hypercubes, the second is one of them, the third element corresponds to the self-dual Euler cell-composedness, and the last one to the digitally well-composedness.
