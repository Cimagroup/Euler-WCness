# Euler-WCness

In this repository the exhaustive study of the 4D cases is provided.

- The file [4d_Euler_dwc.hs](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Euler-WCness/blob/master/4d_Euler_dwc.hs) is the code used to do the exhaustive study. It is written in Haskell.
- The file [dwc_notsChiwc.txt](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Euler-WCness/blob/master/dwc_notsChiwc.txt) is an exhaustive list of configurations of hypercubes in 4D incident to a vertex that are digitally well-composed but  not self-dual Euler. (Size of the set of hypercubes 6,7, and 8. The rest of the examples are their duals). Proof of theorem 20.
- In the file [exhaustive_list.txt](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Euler-WCness/blob/master/exhaustive_list.txt), a list with `(Int, [[Int]],Bool, Bool)` where the first element is the size of the set of hypercubes, the second is one example, the third element corresponds to the self-dual Euler well-composedness, and the last one to the digitally well-composedness.
